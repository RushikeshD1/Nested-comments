# Nested Comments

This is a simple **Nested Comments** system built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to:

- Post new comments.
- Reply to existing comments.
- Delete comments or replies.
- Cancel comment or reply creation.
- Reset the page (reload) with the **Reset** button.

The system is designed to be used in the front-end, with all interactions happening in the browser.

## Features

- **Reply to a comment**: Users can reply to comments, creating a nested structure of replies.
- **Delete a comment/reply**: Users can delete their comments or replies.
- **Cancel comment/reply creation**: A user can cancel writing a comment or reply before posting it.
- **Reset button**: A **Reset** button is available that reloads the page, effectively clearing all current comments and replies.
- **No Edit Functionality**: Currently, the "Edit" feature is not implemented.
